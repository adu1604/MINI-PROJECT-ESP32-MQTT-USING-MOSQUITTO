# MINI-PROJECT-ESP32-MQTT-USING-MOSQUITTO
This IoT mini project demonstrates remote device monitoring and control using standard IoT communication protocols. An ESP32 communicates over Wi-Fi and uses the MQTT publish–subscribe model to send telemetry data and receive control commands, enabling real-time LED control.
